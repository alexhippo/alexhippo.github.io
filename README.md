# alexhippo.github.io Portfolio Website

## 🤔About
Thanks for checking out my portfolio website! This website is now in its 2nd iteration. This time I built this website with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/).

It's my first time building a site with React and Gatsby and I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process. If you have feedback or spot a bug, feel free to raise a Github issue (or even a PR!) and I'll take a look at it when I can.

## 🛠 Installation & Set Up
1. Install Gatsby
```
yarn add gatsby
```

2. Install dependencies
```
yarn
```

3. Start the development server
```
yarn start
```

## 🧐 Testing
Unit tests were written using Jest and the React Testing Library. To run the full suite of unit tests:
```
yarn test
```

e2e tests were written using [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/). To run the full suite of tests using the Cypress test runner:
```
yarn start
yarn cypress open
```

To run the full suite of tests in headless mode using Chrome:
```
yarn test:e2e
```
