<br>
<br>My extensive background in Digital, Media and Video Streaming services enables me to understand the problem as well as collaborate with teams to find and implement a high quality solution. I build and maintain end-to-end web and integration test automation suites from scratch, empowering teams to deliver features faster and with confidence. I am also an advocate for Web Accessibility, testing and contributing to code to comply with WCAG AA standards to help ensure that the web is accessible to all. Whenever I have a spare moment, I also code and ship bugfixes.
<br>
<br>I am currently working at an Aussie broadcaster, SBS (Special Broadcasting Service). My main focus is on the website and APIs supporting the flagship video streaming platform, <a href=\\"https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand\\" aria-label=\\"SBS On Demand\\">SBS On Demand</a>, which is available on a range of Web, Mobile, Smart TVs and Set Top Box platforms and serves over 11000+ hours of content to over 1 million active viewers per month. 
<br> 
<br>Outside of digital life you can find me either running, training for some sort of fitness event, cooking or attempting to electro shuffle.</p>",
