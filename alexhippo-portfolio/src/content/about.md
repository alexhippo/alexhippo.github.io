about: "a little bit about me"
---
I'm a Filipino Australian developer based in Sydney. I'm lucky enough to have over 7 years of professional experience in web design and development, test automation, business analysis and agile delivery.

My extensive background in Digital, Media and Video Streaming services enables me to understand the problem as well as collaborate with others to find and implement a high quality solution. I have built and maintained e2e web and integration test automation suites from scratch, empowering teams to deliver features faster and with confidence. I have experience in implementing and testing for WCAG 2.1 AA Standard Accessibility, doing my part to ensure that the web is accessible to all.

In my spare time I also enjoy coding side projects, check out my portfolio below for more.

I am currently working at an Aussie broadcaster, the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS). I specifically work on the website and APIs supporting SBS' flagship video streaming platform, <a href="https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand" aria-label="SBS On Demand">SBS On Demand</a>, which is available on a range of Web, Mobile, Smart TVs and Set Top Box platforms and serves over 1 million active viewers per month. 
 
Outside of work you can find me either running, cooking or (trying to) electro shuffle.
