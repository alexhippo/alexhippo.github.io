about: "a little bit about me"
---
I'm an Aussie Filipino Web Developer and QA Engineer based in Sydney with over 7 years of experience in coding, ~~breaking~~testing and delivering core features to apps millions of Australians use everyday.

By day, I work at Aussie broadcaster SBS (Special Broadcasting Service) as a QA Analyst. My main focus is the website and APIs supporting the flagship video streaming platform, [SBS On Demand](https://www.sbs.com.au/ondemand), which streams over 11,000+ hours of content to over 1 million active viewers per month. I build and maintain end-to-end and integration test automation scripts, as well as pairing with others to find creative ways of testing features. I am also an advocate for Web Accessibility. Whenever I have a spare moment, I even commit code to fix bugs.

By night, I work on side projects (see my portfolio below) and take online courses to help me become a better developer and tester.
 
Outside of digital life you can find me either running, bushwalking, lifting or baking (Banana Bread is my specialty!)

Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
* Javascript (ES6+)
* Cypress
* HTML & CSS
* React
* Gatsby
