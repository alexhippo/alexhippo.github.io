about: "about"
description: "I'm a digital professional 7+ years of experience in front end web development, test automation, business analysis and agile delivery.

My extensive background in Digital, Media and Video Streaming services enables me to understand the problem as well as collaborate with others to find and implement a high quality solution. I have built e2e web and integration test automation suites from scratch, empowering teams to deliver features faster and with confidence. I enjoy building side project web apps. I also have experience in implementing and testing for WCAG standard accessibility.

I am currently working at the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS), an Australian broadcaster, on their flagship video streaming platform SBS On Demand as a Test Specialist.
 
Outside of work I am an avid runner and enjoy most things fitness and food."
