- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a nonprofit global online community which provides a open source curriculum for learning how to code.
- My study involved over 400 hours of coursework which included introduction and intermediate HTML, CSS and Javascript; basic and intermediate algorithm scripting; and web development projects (please see my portfolio).
