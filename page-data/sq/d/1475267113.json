The game has four buttons with different colours which are lit up by pressing on it, or being activated. A sound also accompanies the buttons when it is pressed. A round in the game starts by lighting one or more colours at random, after which the player must copy that order by pressing the correct colours. As the game progresses, the number of colours to be pressed increase, as well as the speed at which it is presented."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Javascript Calculator","tech":"Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS","thumbnail":"calc.png","link":"https://alexhippo.github.io/projects/jscalculator/","github":"https://github.com/alexhippo/alexhippo.github.io"},"rawMarkdownBody":"A simple calculator that provides the basic mathematical functions similar to what you find on an handheld pocket calculator."}},{"node":{"frontmatter":{"title":"Pomodoro Timer","tech":"Javascript, Bootstrap, HTML, CSS","thumbnail":"../images/pomodoro.jpg","link":"https://alexhippo.github.io/projects/pomodoro/","github":"https://github.com/alexhippo/alexhippo.github.io"},"rawMarkdownBody":"A simple and mobile-responsive productivity timer based off the Pomodoro method - 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes break.
